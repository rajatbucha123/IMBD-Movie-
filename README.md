IMDb Movies India Data Science Project


Overview
This data science project focuses on analyzing Indian movies data to gain insights into various aspects such as genres, ratings, cast, and release trends. The project utilizes datasets containing information about Indian movies, including details like title, release year, genre, cast, crew, and user ratings.

Objectives
1) Explore and visualize trends in Indian movie releases over the years.
2) Analyze the distribution of movie genres and their popularity.
3) Investigate the relationship between movie ratings and other factors like genre, cast, and crew.
4) Predict the success (ratings) of upcoming Indian movies based on historical data.

Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing information about Indian movies sourced from IMDb and other relevant sources. The dataset includes features such as:

Title: Name of the movie
Release Year: Year in which the movie was released
Genre: Category or type of the movie (e.g., Drama, Comedy, Action)
Cast: Actors and actresses appearing in the movie
Crew: Director, writer, and other crew members involved in the production
Ratings: User ratings and reviews

Tools and Technologies
1) Programming Language: Python
2) Libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
3) Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development
4) Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

4) Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Methodology
1) Data Collection: The dataset is obtained from reliable sources such as IMDb and other movie databases.
2) Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, format inconsistencies, and outliers.
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to understand distributions, correlations, and trends using visualizations and statistical methods.
4) Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
5) Model Development: Building machine learning models to predict movie ratings or other relevant outcomes based on features such as genre, cast, crew, etc.


Task
Every dataset has a story and this set is pulled from IMDb.com of all the Indian movies on the platform. Clean this data by removing missing values or adding average values this process will help to manipulate the data to help with your EDA.

# Analyze data and provide some trends.
1) Year with best rating
2) Does length of movie have any impact with the rating?
3) Top 10 movies according to rating per year and overall.
4) Number of popular movies released each year.
5) Counting the number of votes which movies preformed better in rating per year and overall.
6) Any other trends or future prediction you may have
7) Which director directed the most movies
8) Which actor starred in the movie
9) Any other trends you can find
10) Train the data with y is [Rating] and x is ['Duration','Number_of_votes','Total_votes', 'Directors','Genres']
